# Contributions

- Fork this repository.
- Create a new branch for your changes. Do not make pull requests from your master branch.
- Use Github pull requests.
- Always write descriptive commit messages and pull request descriptions. Descriptive is not necessarily long. For simple changes (such as typo fix or better error handling for a simple case) are easy to describe briefly.
- Follow up on your pull requests - if there are change requests, it is up to you to fix things (or argue why the request does not make sense).

## What is welcomed?

- Both small and large changes (typo fixes / new features / refactoring)
- Relevant Slack and/or G Suite integrations
- UI improvements (both looks and functionality)
- New functionality related to already-existing things (for example, better visualizations; better ways to browse and explore the data; better support for fixed-price projects)

## What is not welcomed?

- Support for anything else than 10000ft. This service is tightly tied to 10000ft, and there are no plans to extend that to other platforms.
- Integrations to other services (other than Slack/G Suite). If you have something in mind for this, please ask before contributing.
